# IMU and GPS Sensor Fusion with ROS 2

## Overview

This project focuses on integrating and analyzing IMU and GPS data for precise navigation using sensor fusion techniques. It includes ROS 2 packages for real-time IMU and GPS data collection, custom message formats, and MATLAB-based post-processing for calibration and analysis.

The project addresses challenges like sensor drift, noise, and distortions, applying advanced techniques like magnetometer calibration, velocity estimation, and dead reckoning.

## Key Techniques

### Magnetometer Calibration
1. **Hard-Iron Distortion**:
   - Offsets are calculated using:
     ```math
     offset_x = (max_x + min_x) / 2
     offset_y = (max_y + min_y) / 2
     ```
   - These offsets are subtracted from raw magnetometer readings.

2. **Soft-Iron Distortion**:
   - Scaling factors are applied to correct axis-wise distortions.

3. **Yaw Calculation**:
   - Using corrected magnetometer readings:
     ```math
     yaw = atan2(magy_calibrated, magx_calibrated)
     ```

### Velocity Estimation
- IMU-derived velocity is obtained by integrating forward acceleration:
  ```math
  v(t) = âˆ« a(t) dt
  ```
- GPS velocity is computed by calculating the Euclidean distance between successive GPS points

### Dead Reckoning
- Position estimates are derived by integrating IMU-derived velocities over time and compared with GPS-based displacements

### Sensor Fusion
- A complementary filter combines low-pass filtered magnetometer yaw and high-pass filtered gyroscope yaw to improve robustness
